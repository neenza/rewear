# ReWear - Technical Plan & Architecture

## Project Overview
ReWear is a web-based platform for exchanging unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The platform aims to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by encouraging garment reuse.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
  - Provides strong typing, component-based architecture, and robust ecosystem
  - Enables creation of reusable UI components
- **UI Library**: Material-UI / Chakra UI
  - Offers pre-built accessible components
  - Supports responsive design out of the box
  - Consistent theming and styling
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
  - Centralized state management for user data, items, and authentication
  - Predictable state updates
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
  - Efficient form validation with less re-renders
  - Seamless integration with validation libraries
- **Routing**: React Router
  - Handle navigation between pages
  - Protected routes for authenticated users
- **API Communication**: Axios
  - Consistent API request handling
  - Request/response interceptors for error handling


### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
  - High-performance, modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
  - Asynchronous support for handling many concurrent requests efficiently
  - Automatic data validation and serialization using Pydantic
- **Type Hints**
  - Python type hints for better code quality and editor support
- **API Documentation**: Built-in OpenAPI/Swagger UI
  - Automatic, interactive API docs generated from code

### Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Relational database for structured data with complex relationships
  - ACID compliance for data integrity
  - Strong support for complex queries and relationships between users, items, and transactions

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
  - Stateless authentication
  - Role-based access control (user vs admin)

### File Storage
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or similar
  - Scalable storage for item images
  - CDN integration for fast content delivery

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker
  - Consistent development and production environments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing and deployment pipeline
- **Hosting**: AWS, Azure, or Vercel/Netlify for frontend
  - Scalable cloud infrastructure

## Database Schema Design

- status (requested, accepted, rejected, completed)
- points_used (for point-based redemptions)
- created_at
- updated_at

#### Tags

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/auth/me

### Users
- GET /api/users/profile
- PUT /api/users/profile
- GET /api/users/:id/items

### Items
- POST /api/items (create new item)
- GET /api/items (with filtering, pagination)
- GET /api/items/:id (item details)
- PUT /api/items/:id (update item)
- DELETE /api/items/:id

### Swaps
- POST /api/swaps (request swap)
- GET /api/swaps (user's swaps)
- PUT /api/swaps/:id (accept/reject/complete)
- GET /api/swaps/:id

### Admin
- GET /api/admin/items/pending
- PUT /api/admin/items/:id/approve
- PUT /api/admin/items/:id/reject

## Implementation Approach

### Code Quality & Standards
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and quality
- Husky pre-commit hooks for enforcing standards
- Comprehensive test coverage (Jest, React Testing Library)
- TypeScript for type safety across the application

### Performance Optimization
- Implement data caching strategies:
  - Redis for API responses and frequent database queries
  - Browser caching for static assets
  - React Query for frontend data fetching and caching
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting for reduced bundle size
- Server-side rendering for SEO and initial load performance

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling middleware on backend
- Consistent error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Frontend error boundaries for graceful UI degradation
- Comprehensive logging (Winston/Pino)

### Security Measures
- Input validation (frontend and backend)
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)
- Intuitive navigation with breadcrumbs
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Skeleton loading states for perceived performance
- Toast notifications for user actions
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Dark/light mode support
